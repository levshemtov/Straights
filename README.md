# Straighs (CS246 Final Project)

I made the game "straights," as described in [the specification document](./straights.pdf).
This game is written entirely in `C++`. Check out [a demo](./DD2-pdfs/demo/demo.pdf) for a tour of the various supported features.
Take a look at the [design document](./DD2-pdfs/DesignDoc/design.pdf) for the project structure, design, and some other implementation details.


## How to run / build

1. In the command line, run the `make` command

2. Play the game by running the executable `straights`, [demo.pdf](./DD2-pdfs/demo/demo.pdf) contains more details.
